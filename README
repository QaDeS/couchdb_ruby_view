Installation
------------
Copy bin/couchdb_ruby_view to somewhere like /usr/local/bin, and make
sure it is executable.

Edit /usr/local/etc/couchdb/local.ini and set:

[query_servers]
ruby = /usr/local/bin/couchdb_ruby_view

Restart couchdb.

API
---
map:

  proc { |doc|
    ...
    emit(key,val)
    ...
  }

reduce/rereduce:

  proc { |ks,vs,rereduce|
    vs.inject(0) { |a,b| a+b }
  }

Note that CouchDB actually passes objects which could be iterated directly
using { |(k,id),v| ... }. However I've split these into separate arrays of
[k,id] and v for consistency with the Javascript view server, and because it
simplifies some reduce/rereduce functions (as in the example above, where
both reduce and rereduce are the same)
